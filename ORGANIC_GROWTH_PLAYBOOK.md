## QUICK START: IMMEDIATE TRAFFIC (Day 1)

> **For established accounts (1+ year old) with low karma.** No need to wait 4 weeks.

### Your Account Status
- **Age:** 1 year (GOOD - not suspicious)
- **Karma:** 1 (LOW - needs boost but won't block you)
- **Communities:** r/technology, r/artificial, r/Startup_Ideas, r/Bubbleio

### Day 1-3: Multi-Platform Blitz

**LINKEDIN (Start NOW - Already credible)**
```
Action: Post immediately as founder
Why: LinkedIn rewards founder stories, no karma system
Expected result: 500-2000 views, 10-50 new connections

Post template:
"I spent 6 months solving [problem].

Here's what I learned about finding customers organically:

1. [Insight with specific data]
2. [Counterintuitive finding]
3. [What actually works]

Building Liftlio to automate this.
What's your approach?"
```

**REDDIT (Parallel karma building)**
```
Action: 10 quality comments/day in communities you're already in
Target subs (where you're already active):
- r/Startup_Ideas - respond to every new idea post
- r/technology - comment on AI/automation news
- r/artificial - share insights on AI applications

Comment style that gets upvotes:
- Specific, actionable advice
- Personal experience ("I tried this and...")
- Contrarian but respectful takes
- Asking smart follow-up questions
```

**TWITTER (If logged in)**
```
Action: Start threads immediately
Why: No karma system, fresh accounts can go viral
Topic: "I analyzed [X] and here's what I found..."
```

### Karma Boost Tricks (Reddit-specific)

**High-upvote comment patterns:**
1. **First to comment** on rising posts = most visibility
2. **Ask clarifying questions** = engagement magnet
3. **Share specific numbers** = credibility signal
4. **Respectfully disagree** = drives discussion

**Subreddits that give karma fast:**
| Subreddit | Why | Comment Strategy |
|-----------|-----|------------------|
| r/Startup_Ideas | Low competition | Detailed feedback on ideas |
| r/SaaS | Engaged community | Answer "how do I..." questions |
| r/Entrepreneur | High volume | Early comments on trending posts |

### Traffic-First Actions (Do Today)

| Platform | Action | Expected Traffic |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Post founder story | 50-200 profile visits |
| **Reddit** | 10 valuable comments | 5-20 profile clicks |
| **Twitter** | 1 thread + 20 replies | 20-100 profile visits |
| **Quora** | Answer 2 high-traffic questions | 50-500 views over time |

### The Hybrid Approach (Your Situation)

Since your account is OLD but karma is LOW:
- **LinkedIn:** Go full "Founder of Liftlio" NOW
- **Reddit:** Professional mode for 1 week (not 4), then disclose
- **Twitter:** Can be transparent immediately
- **HN/Quora:** Build credibility first (2 weeks)

---

## PERSONA STRATEGY (REFERENCE)

### The Two-Phase Approach

**Adjusted for established accounts:** Phase 1 = 1 week, not 4 weeks.

---

### PHASE 1: CREDIBILITY BOOST (Days 1-7)
**Persona: Growth/Marketing Professional (NO product mention)**

```
Goal: Build karma/engagement quickly
Duration: 1 WEEK (account is already aged)
Liftlio mentions: ZERO on Reddit, OK on LinkedIn/Twitter

How to present yourself:
- "Been working in growth/marketing for X years..."
- "I focus on organic lead generation..."
- "From my experience with video marketing..."

What to do:
- Comment with genuine insights about marketing, growth, automation
- Share learnings from your actual experience (without mentioning Liftlio)
- Help people solve problems
- Build karma/followers/connections

What NOT to do:
- Mention Liftlio or any product you're building
- Hint at having a solution
- Drop links of any kind
```

**Phase 1 Comment Examples:**
```
On r/SaaS - "How do you find leads organically?"

"Been grinding on this for 2 years. What actually moved the needle:

1. Monitoring conversations where people ask for solutions (Reddit, Twitter, YT comments)
2. Responding with genuine help, not pitches
3. Building relationships before asking for anything

The key is being where your customers already are, not trying to pull them somewhere new."
```

```
On r/marketing - "Best way to track brand mentions?"

"Depends on your volume. For low volume, Google Alerts + manual checks work.
For higher volume, you need something that monitors video platforms too -
lot of brand conversations happen in YouTube comments that people miss.

What's your main use case?"
```

---

### PHASE 2: TRANSPARENT FOUNDER (Week 5+)
**Persona: Liftlio Founder (100% transparent)**

```
Goal: Convert credibility into awareness
Trigger: Only when directly relevant to conversation
Format: Always disclose your role

How to present yourself:
- "Disclosure: I'm building a tool in this space, so biased..."
- "Founder of Liftlio here - obviously I have skin in the game, but..."
- "I built something for this (Liftlio), but here's the honest take..."

What to do:
- Continue 80% value-add comments (no product mention)
- 20% can include Liftlio when DIRECTLY relevant
- Always acknowledge bias
- Be honest about limitations
- Invite questions/feedback

What NOT to do:
- Spam every thread
- Pretend to be unbiased
- Hide your affiliation
- Get defensive about criticism
```

**Phase 2 Comment Examples:**
```
On r/SaaS - "What tools do you use for monitoring YouTube comments?"

"Disclosure: I'm building Liftlio which does exactly this, so obviously biased.

That said, here's the honest landscape:
- Brand24 is solid for social, weaker on video
- Mention is good but expensive at scale
- Liftlio (mine) focuses specifically on video platforms

What's your volume like? Happy to give a more specific rec based on your needs."
```

```
On HN - "Show HN: Liftlio - Find customers in video comments"

"Hey HN, founder here.

Built this because I was manually checking YouTube comments for leads and
it was brutal. Now it monitors for buying intent and notifies in real-time.

Stack: React, Supabase, Claude for sentiment.

Not perfect yet - still working on TikTok integration and the AI sometimes
flags false positives. Would love feedback on the UX especially.

```

### Why This Works

| Fake User Approach | Transparent Founder Approach |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| If discovered = destroyed trust | Nothing to hide |
| Community feels manipulated | Community respects honesty |
| Can be banned permanently | Never banned for transparency |
| Short-term gains only | Long-term relationships |
| Stressful (constant hiding) | Authentic (no cognitive load) |

### The Proof

**Successful founders who do this:**
- @levelsio (Pieter Levels) - Always transparent, $2M+ ARR from organic
- @marckohlbrugge - WIP.co founder, openly promotes, respected
- Lemlist founder on Reddit - "founder here" in every comment, high karma

**Companies that got caught faking:**
- Multiple cases of permanent Reddit bans + viral exposure posts
- Once exposed, impossible to recover reputation in that community

---

### Current Phase Status (ACCELERATED)

> **Account is 1 year old = faster progression allowed**

| Platform | Current Phase | Milestone | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Reddit | Phase 1 | 50 karma → Phase 2 | ~1 week |
| LinkedIn | **Phase 2 NOW** | Post as founder today | Day 1 |
| Twitter | **Phase 2 NOW** | Can be transparent | Day 1 |
| HN | Phase 1 | 30 karma → Phase 2 | ~2 weeks |
| Quora | Phase 1 | 5 answers → Phase 2 | ~1 week |

**Why accelerated:** Old account = not suspicious. Just needs engagement boost.

### 2. LINKEDIN - B2B Authority Building

#### Why LinkedIn Matters
- **1B members**, 200M in US
- **4x higher visitor-to-lead conversion** than other platforms
- **Decision makers actively scroll** during work
- **Algorithm favors native content** (no external links)
- **Comments get massive reach** on popular posts

#### Content Strategy

**Post Types (Weekly Mix)**
| Type | Frequency | Best Time (EST) | Format |
|------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Story Post | 2x/week | Tue/Thu 8-9am | Personal narrative |
| Data/Insight | 1x/week | Wed 10am | Numbers + analysis |
| Contrarian Take | 1x/week | Mon 9am | Challenge convention |
| How-To | 1x/week | Fri 8am | Step-by-step |

**Algorithm Hacks**
1. **No external links in main post** - Put in first comment
2. **First 2 hours critical** - Engage heavily with all comments
3. **Hook in first line** - Must stop the scroll

5. **End with question** - Drives engagement

**Comment Strategy (30/day minimum)**
```
Target: Posts by
- Marketing VPs/Directors

when testing this. Curious - did you see different results
with [specific variable]?"
```

#### LinkedIn Rules

## 🖼️ BLOG IMAGE WORKFLOW (CRÍTICO - Added 2026-01-03)

> **⚠️ NUNCA usar caminhos locais para imagens do blog!**
> Imagens locais (`/blog-images/...`) NÃO aparecem em produção.

### Fluxo Correto para Imagens de Artigos

```
1. GERAR IMAGEM
   → Gemini: https://gemini.google.com/app (gratuito, requer login Google)
   → Pollinations: Via script .claude/scripts/pollinations-image.sh
   → Salvar localmente em: liftlio-react/public/blog-images/

2. UPLOAD PARA SUPABASE STORAGE
   → Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/suqjifkhmekcdflwowiw/storage/buckets/blog-images
   → Ou via MCP Browser (navegar ao Dashboard → Storage → blog-images → Upload)
   → Bucket: blog-images (público)

3. USAR URL DO SUPABASE NO BANCO
   → Formato: https://suqjifkhmekcdflwowiw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/[filename]
   → Atualizar cover_image_url no blog_posts via SQL ou Admin Panel
```

### URLs de Imagens

| Tipo | Exemplo | Funciona em Produção? |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| ❌ Local | `/blog-images/minha-imagem.png` | **NÃO** |
| ✅ Supabase Storage | `https://suqjifkhmekcdflwowiw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/minha-imagem.png` | **SIM** |

### Exemplo de Update no Banco

```sql
UPDATE blog_posts
SET cover_image_url = 'https://suqjifkhmekcdflwowiw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/blog-images/nome-da-imagem.png'
WHERE id = [ID_DO_ARTIGO];
```

### Verificação Rápida

Se imagem não aparece no blog:
1. Verificar se arquivo existe no Supabase Storage
2. Verificar se URL no banco começa com `https://suqjifkhmekcdflwowiw.supabase.co/storage/...`
3. Se URL começar com `/blog-images/`, está errado - precisa fazer upload pro Storage

### Admin Panel (localhost:3000/admin?view=blog)

O campo "Featured Image" no admin aceita apenas **URL** (não tem upload direto).
Workflow:
1. Upload imagem no Supabase Dashboard primeiro
2. Copiar URL pública
3. Colar no campo do admin
