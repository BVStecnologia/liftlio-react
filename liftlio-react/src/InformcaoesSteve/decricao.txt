[13:18, 28/09/2025] Steven J. EUA: We'll also need a contact page with the following details. I will want to get this number removed as soon as it gets approved but for now I think it's important to have it on there to show this info is accurate on the profile. This can be a very simple page too. Just need the info on there for the appeal.

If you add a contact form we'll need to have reCAPTCHA added for sure. The spam would get crazy if not. You can also just add the email and use [ at ] instead of the @ symbol. That should stop much of the automated stuff.
