# Chrome Extension Interference Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing issues with Chrome extensions (specifically `chrome-extension://hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp`) interfering with fetch calls, causing network requests to fail.

## Error Pattern

```
TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at chrome-extension://hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp/js/content.js:1:9745
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fetch Wrapper (`src/utils/fetchWrapper.ts`)

Created a robust fetch wrapper that:
- Detects extension-related errors
- Provides automatic retry logic
- Falls back to XMLHttpRequest when fetch is intercepted
- Adds proper headers and error handling

### 2. Updated Supabase Client (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`)

- Integrated the custom fetch wrapper with Supabase client
- Added early detection of extension issues
- Updated RPC and Edge Function calls to use safe fetch

### 3. Extension Warning Component (`src/components/ExtensionWarning.tsx`)

Created a user-friendly warning banner that:
- Appears when extension interference is detected
- Provides clear instructions for users
- Offers quick actions (incognito mode, manage extensions)
- Only shows once per session

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling (`src/utils/networkErrorHandler.ts`)

- Improved detection of extension-related errors
- Better error messages with actionable steps
- Support for multiple browser extension formats

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The system monitors for errors containing extension URLs
2. **Mitigation**: When detected, it tries alternative request methods
3. **User Notification**: Shows a warning banner with solutions
4. **Fallback**: Uses XMLHttpRequest if fetch is compromised

## User Instructions

When users encounter extension issues, they can:

1. **Use Incognito Mode** (Recommended)
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)

2. **Disable Problematic Extensions**
   - Chrome: Visit chrome://extensions/
   - Firefox: Visit about:addons
   - Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit

3. **Use a Different Browser**
   - As a temporary workaround

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Install a browser extension that intercepts network requests
2. Try to use the application
3. Verify that:
   - The warning banner appears
   - Requests still complete (via fallback)
   - Error messages are user-friendly

## Known Extensions That May Cause Issues

- Ad blockers (some aggressive ones)
- Privacy/security extensions
- Developer tools extensions
- VPN browser extensions
- Script blockers

## Future Improvements

- Add telemetry to track which extensions cause issues
- Implement more sophisticated retry strategies
- Consider WebSocket alternatives for real-time features
- Add extension whitelist/blacklist configuration
