## 2026-01-01 - Initial Engagement Round

### LinkedIn
| Metric | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Likes | 15+ | AI agents, automation, LLM posts |
| Comments | 5 | Technical insights, no self-promotion |
| Profile | Updated | "Cloud infrastructure for AI agents that work on the web" |

### Hacker News
| Post | Type | Key Points |
|------|------|------------|
| "Building an internal agent: Code-driven vs LLM-driven workflows" | Technical Comment | LLM for intent/unexpected states, deterministic code for execution. Trajectory-level evals > step-level tests. |
| "Show HN: OpenWorkers – Self-hosted Cloudflare workers in Rust" | Technical Comment | AI agent workloads hit Cloudflare limits. V8 isolates for security. Question about persistence/KV store. |

### Reddit r/MachineLearning
| Post | Action | Permalink |
|------|--------|-----------|
| "[R] DeepSeek: mHC Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections" | Upvote + Comment | /r/MachineLearning/comments/1q11e11/comment/nx6e2gc/ |
| "[P] Eigenvalues as models - scaling, robustness and interpretability" | Comment | /r/MachineLearning/comments/1q11pom/comment/nx6edhh/ |

**Comment Themes:**

## 2026-01-02 - Twitter/X Engagement Round

### Twitter/X
| Post Author | Topic | Reply Theme | Action |
|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| @AndrewBolis | Agentic AI vs Traditional LLM | Hybrid approach: LLM for intent + deterministic code for execution. Memory/feedback loops, state persistence | Like + Reply |
| @mrjoyenxr0 | n8n + Claude integration | Error handling patterns: try/catch nodes, structured JSON output, fallback logic for agent resilience | Like + Reply |
| @SHIVANIGERA5 | AI skills for 2026 | LLM evaluation as underrated skill. Offline eval sets, synthetic data for iteration, "vibes-testing" vs production-ready | Like + Reply |

**Reply Themes:**
- Agent architecture (LLM + deterministic code hybrid)
- Error handling and resilience in AI workflows
- Evaluation methodology (offline evals, synthetic data)

**Metrics:**
- Likes given: 3
- Technical replies: 3
- Self-promotion: 0 (engagement-first strategy)
