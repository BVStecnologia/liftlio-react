POTENTIAL ISSUES FOUND AND FIXES APPLIED
---------------------------------------
1. Nav Walker Class
   - Issue: Custom nav walker might not handle all menu scenarios
   - Fix: Added null coalescing operators (??) for args properties
   - Status: FIXED

2. PHP Version Compatibility
   - Issue: Null coalescing operator requires PHP 7.0+
   - Recommendation: Add PHP version check in theme activation
   - Status: NOTED

3. Translation Support
   - Issue: Text domain 'liftlio-blog' used but no language files
   - Recommendation: Add languages folder and .pot file for translations
   - Status: OPTIONAL

4. Google Fonts
   - Issue: External resource loaded without local fallback
   - Recommendation: Consider hosting fonts locally for better performance
