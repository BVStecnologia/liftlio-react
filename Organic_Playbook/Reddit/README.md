## Templates COM LINK

### Template 1: Customer Acquisition / Growth
**Usar em:** Posts sobre CAC, leads, growth
```
been thinking about this a lot. the shift from interruption marketing to showing up in conversations is real. when someone asks for help and you actually help them, trust is instant vs spending months building a brand.

wrote about how this changes everything: https://liftlio.com/blog/comment-marketing-strategy-free-leads
```

### Template 2: AI / Automation
**Usar em:** Posts sobre AI tools, automation
```
this is where AI gets interesting for marketing. not just automating outreach but actually identifying where conversations are happening and showing up with value. word of mouth at scale basically.

more on this here: https://liftlio.com/blog/youtube-engagement-2026-manual-marketing-dead
```

### Template 3: Growth Hacks / Tactics
**Usar em:** Posts sobre growth hacks, tactics
```
the hack that nobody talks about is engagement marketing. instead of creating content and hoping people find it, you find the conversations and add value there. seen some crazy conversion numbers with this approach.

breakdown here: https://liftlio.com/blog/pics-framework-identify-leads-youtube-comments
```

### Template 4: YouTube / Video Marketing
**Usar em:** Posts sobre YouTube, video
```
youtube is underrated for b2b honestly. not creating videos but engaging in comments. when a niche video blows up your comment gets thousands of views. been tracking this and the ROI is insane compared to paid.

wrote about the algorithm advantage: https://liftlio.com/blog/first-comment-youtube-algorithm-advantage
```

### Template 5: Trust / Recommendations
**Usar em:** Posts sobre ads vs organic, trust
```
the real unlock with AI in marketing isnt automation of outreach. its finding where your customers already are talking and showing up with value at scale. engagement beats interruption every time.

## Templates SEM LINK (Valor Only)

### Template: Validacao / MVP
```
honestly the best validation is just shipping something ugly and seeing if anyone cares. spent way too long on polish before and nobody wanted it anyway. now i build the core thing in a weekend and put it in front of real users immediately
```

### Template: Email / Subject Lines
```
the best performing subject lines ive seen are the ones that look like they came from a coworker not a company. short, lowercase, no formatting. open rates go through the roof because people dont filter them as marketing
```

### Template: Local Business / SMB
```
best move for service businesses is showing up where people already talk about your niche. local facebook groups, neighborhood apps. when someone asks for help and you answer with genuine advice you become the trusted expert
