Most SaaS founders focus on paid acquisition, but the channels with highest conversion rates are still organic ones.

Here's what's working in 2026:

1. Community-led acquisition - Show up where your customers already hang out (Reddit, niche communities, YouTube comments). When someone posts "struggling with X" and you genuinely help, trust is instant.

2. Content that solves problems - Instead of generic blog posts, create content that answers specific questions your customers are actively searching for.

3. Comment marketing - Engage in genuine conversations across platforms. Not spammy promotion, but actually adding value to discussions. The leads that come from this convert 3-4x better than cold outreach.

I wrote a detailed breakdown of organic acquisition strategies here: https://liftlio.com/blog/comment-marketing-strategy-free-leads

The key is showing up consistently where your audience already is, rather than trying to pull them to where you are.

**How do I get thousands of customers without paying for ads?**
```
comment marketing on youtube worked really well for me. instead of paying for ads i go to videos where my target customers hang out and leave helpful comments answering their questions. not spammy links, just genuine value.

the people who click through to my profile are already warm because they saw me being useful first. took about 2-3 months of consistent commenting but now i get leads every week without spending anything on ads.
