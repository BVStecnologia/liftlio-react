## Conteudo do Post

```
everyone talks about consistency in content. few actually do it.

last week i ran an experiment: 100 posts across 6 platforms in 4 days. not scheduled. not automated. manual, one by one.

here's what i learned:

consistency isn't posting daily on one platform. it's showing up everywhere your audience already is. reddit, linkedin, twitter, quora, indie hackers, facebook groups - all at once.

the 70/30 rule saved me from looking like spam:
- 70% pure value (no links, no pitch)
- 30% contextual links to deeper content

the biggest surprise? responding to notifications BEFORE creating new content changed everything. people noticed i was actually there, not just broadcasting.

results after 4 days:
- 99% of posts stayed up (only 1 flagged as "too AI")
- 20% of people i engaged with replied back
- multi-day conversations started organically

paid ads disappear when you stop paying. organic compounds forever.

building something to help founders stay consistent without burning out. curious - what's the hardest part about showing up consistently for you?
