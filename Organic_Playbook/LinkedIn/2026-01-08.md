## Comentarios Enviados

### 1. Jason M. Lemkin - AI Agents Post ✅
**Tema:** AI agents no B2B, diferenca entre "AI feature" e "AI teammate"
**Post original:** "Can your customers truly talk to your B2B app -- for real? As well or better than ChatGPT or Claude?"

**Comentario POSTADO:**
```
the gap between "AI feature" and "AI teammate" is massive. most b2b apps bolt on chatbots that feel like fancy search bars. the real test is whether customers actually prefer talking to the AI over clicking through menus. when that happens you know you've built something that sticks
```

### 2. Louis Fernandes - Revenue Architecture ✅
**Tema:** Strategy vs Architecture, execution capability
**Post original:** "Revenue Architecture: Why Strategy Without Architecture Always Fails"

**Comentario POSTADO:**
```
this resonates. seen too many startups confuse a great strategy deck with actual execution capability. the gap is always in the "how do we actually do this week to week" part. architecture forces you to answer that before you burn runway figuring it out

### 3. Creatives Takeover - Retention ✅
**Tema:** Growth vs Retention, fundamentos de negocio
**Post original:** "Growth is fakeable. Retention isn't" - sobre retention strategy

**Comentario POSTADO:**
```
retention is the ultimate bs detector. you can hack signups with ads and free trials but if people dont come back theres no business to scale. the best founders i know check retention weekly before they even look at top of funnel
```

### 4. Jean-Michel Moreau - Churn vs Acquisition ✅
**Tema:** SaaS CEOs queimando dinheiro em acquisition, churn como problema real
**Post original:** "SaaS CEOs, tired of burning cash on acquisition? 90% of your company's success lives on the back end"

**Comentario POSTADO:**
```
the math is undeniable. spent years chasing acquisition when the answer was sitting in our existing customer base. one simple change we made was reviewing churned users weekly instead of monthly - caught patterns early and fixed the product gaps before they became hemorrhages. retention compounds quietly but it compounds
```

### 5. Subrardhan Singh - Platform Fatigue + CAC ✅ COM LINK
**Tema:** Enterprise platform fatigue, CAC aumentou 22% YoY
**Post original:** "Wayfair's CTO said it out loud: enterprises want better capabilities, not your entire ecosystem"

**Comentario POSTADO (COM LINK):**
```
the cac spike is real. went through this ourselves - paid channels kept getting more expensive while conversion stayed flat. shifted focus to organic discovery channels and saw cac drop significantly. wrote about the economics here: https://liftlio.com/blog/the-2-for-1-problem-cac-crisis the vendors that win will be the ones meeting buyers where they already are, not forcing platform lock-in
