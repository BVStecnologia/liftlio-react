### Comentarios Enviados

**Pradeep Aradhya - Jason Lemkin AI agents post:**
```
interesting shift. the nuance most miss is that AI agents work best for high-volume, pattern-based conversations not complex enterprise deals. curious how this plays out for mid-market where relationships still matter but scale is needed
```

**Coretus Technologies - New sales floor at SaaStr:**
```
the shift from "doing the work" to "designing the workflow" is real. but the risk nobody talks about is that most companies lack the technical talent to orchestrate these agents properly. you still need humans who understand both sales psychology AND ai architecture - that combo is rare

```
the irony is that while everyone's automating outbound, the channels with highest conversion are still the organic ones. youtube comments, community discussions, reddit threads - when someone sees you actually helping vs pitching, trust is instant.
