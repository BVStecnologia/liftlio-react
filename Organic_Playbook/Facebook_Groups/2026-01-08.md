### 1. Pavel Pavel - AI Content Generator (SaaS Founders)
**Topico:** AI tool que gera marketing content
**Comentario:**
```
the real magic with tools like this isnt just the generation - its removing the friction from brand consistency. most founders spend way too much time making sure their content "looks right" instead of actually shipping. if the AI can scan and maintain that consistency automatically thats a real unlock for velocity

### 2. Jacob Perks - Vibe App Scanner (SaaS Founders)
**Topico:** Security scanner para apps feitos com AI
**Comentario:**
```
this is actually super useful. security is probably the most overlooked part of vibe coding. people ship fast with AI tools but forget about exposed API keys, missing RLS, rate limiting etc. the fact that it generates a report AI can use to fix issues is clever - reduces friction to actually fixing the problems instead of just knowing about them

### 3. Marketing Automation Post (Growth Hub)
**Topico:** Marketing automation strategies
**Comentario:**
```
this is where AI gets interesting for marketing. not just automating outreach but actually identifying where conversations are happening and showing up with value. word of mouth at scale basically.

**Status:** ✅ POSTADO (valor only x2)

### 6. Online Biz Offers - Notion vs Quibi (Startups Investors Entrepreneurs)
**Topico:** Product comparison
**Comentario:**
```
the real shift here is from brand interruption to brand conversation. people trust recommendations from helpful community members way more than ads. showing up in conversations with actual value beats spending months building brand awareness

### 7. Jonah Whiteley - Property Maintenance (Small business owners)
**Topico:** Handyman business - getting clients without pushy ads
**Comentario:**
```
best move for service businesses is showing up where people already talk about your niche. local facebook groups, neighborhood apps, even youtube videos about home maintenance. when someone asks for help and you answer with genuine advice you become the trusted expert. thats how you get referrals without feeling salesy - people remember who actually helped them

### 8. Lori Dietrich - Dropshipping (Small business owners)
**Topico:** Mom paying $8k/month for website management
**Comentario:**
```
8k monthly for inventory management is wild. there are tons of APIs and tools that can automate multi-channel inventory sync for a fraction of that cost. shopify has apps that do this for like 50-200/month depending on SKU count. sounds like whoever is managing this knows she doesnt understand the tech side and is taking advantage. might be worth getting a second opinion from someone who actually specializes in ecommerce automation

### 9. Jose Alfredo Delgado - Outsourcing (Small business owners)
**Topico:** What work do you typically outsource?
**Comentario:**
```
for business - engagement and community management. manually replying to comments and showing up in relevant conversations takes way too much time but its one of the highest ROI activities. finding tools that help identify where your customers already hang out and when to engage is a game changer. wrote about this approach here: https://liftlio.com/blog/comment-marketing-strategy-free-leads

### 10. Adil Vp - Wedding Business AI Video (Small business owners)
**Topico:** Looking for free AI video tools for wedding ads
**Comentario:**
```
honestly for weddings i'd skip the AI-generated stuff entirely. couples want to see YOUR work not stock footage. start with your phone and film real moments from events you work at. even 15-30 second clips of setup details or happy guests performs way better than polished AI ads. authenticity converts in this niche. also check out canva and capcut for free editing - they have wedding templates that look professional without needing a budget
