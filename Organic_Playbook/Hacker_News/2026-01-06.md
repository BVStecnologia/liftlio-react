**Show HN: OpenWorkers - resposta ao @max_lt:**
```
nice, KV + Postgres covers most of our use cases. the TTL on KV is useful for caching auth tokens between invocations without worrying about cleanup.

for long-running tasks we've been using a queue pattern anyway - worker picks up task, does a chunk, writes state to KV, exits. next invocation picks up where it left off. works around timeout limits and handles retries gracefully. websockets would be nice for real-time feedback but polling works fine for now.

will keep an eye on the durable objects progress. that's the main thing missing for stateful agent workflows where you need guaranteed delivery.
