totally agree. the marketing piece that matthew mentioned is huge - so many good products die in silence because founders (myself included) underestimate distribution.

had a few projects that failed not because the product was bad but because i was stuck in "build it and they'll come" mode. biggest lesson was realizing organic discovery channels beat paid acquisition for early traction - people trust recommendations they find naturally way more than ads.

wrote about this shift here: https://liftlio.com/blog/why-buyers-trust-recommendations-over-ads

the founders who share openly about what didn't work are doing everyone a favor. patterns become visible way faster when more people contribute data.

for me it's when strangers start showing up without me trying. early on you're pushing - sharing with friends, posting everywhere, hoping someone notices. the shift happens when people find you through word of mouth or organic discovery.

that's when it stops being validation theater and becomes actual demand. at that point you either double down on distribution or accept it stays a hobby. most side projects die because founders never crack that early traction loop, not because the product wasn't good enough.
