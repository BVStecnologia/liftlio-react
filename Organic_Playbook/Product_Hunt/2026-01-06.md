### Comentario Enviado

**Founder personas discussion (Nika):**
```
interesting thread. i think there's a middle ground that gets overlooked: instead of paying agencies to post content on your behalf, you can build presence by engaging in communities where your target customers already hang out.

commenting on relevant discussions, answering questions in forums, being helpful in subreddits - this takes time but the trust you build is real. when people see you actually know your stuff (not just polished content), they're way more likely to check out what you're building.

the founder-influencer thing works when it's authentic. paying $5k/month for ghostwritten posts might grow followers but if you can't actually have a conversation about your space, people notice. the replies and engagement is where the real credibility comes from, not the posts themselves.
